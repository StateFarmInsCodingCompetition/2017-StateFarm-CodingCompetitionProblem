1. I was not able to fully complete any jUnit, and only got a couple of passes on the first one. 
2. Overall the problem seemed kind of simple, but actually implementing I could not find out a correct way to do it. I went over some of the easier 2013 example problems, getting part way through the security matrix problem, and they were easier for me than the 2017 problems.
