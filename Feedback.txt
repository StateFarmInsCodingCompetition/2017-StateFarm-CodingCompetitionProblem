         I don't really have any feedback to give as I feel I was unprepared to even appreciate the contest. Once I realized
         I was stuck on implementing the iterator for the class I did not know where to go from there. I worked on the Iterator class
         for quite some time without avail. The Java docs did not clarify to me how I should implement it so I have resigned to 
         submitting what I have and preparing better for the competition next year.
