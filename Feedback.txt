Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.	
Step 1:	We added a new method to the PolyBlockImpl class called PrintGraphStats, that prints out the number of nodes 
connected to a given PolyBlock and then prints out an adjacency list representation of the connected component. Here
is some example output from this method, for a specific graph given in ExtraDemo.java:

"This PolyBlock includes a total of 5 vertices.
If we number the vertices 1 through 5, we get the following adjacency lists.
1: [2, 5]
2: [1, 3, 4]
3: [2, 4]
4: [3, 2]
5: [1]"

You can generate this output by running ExtraDemo.java.
