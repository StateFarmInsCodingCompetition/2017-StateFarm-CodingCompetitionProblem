How many JUnits were you able to get to pass?
I was able to get 9 tests passing.

I had trouble trying to keep the building block implementation capable of handling other building blocks by using purely the interface. If I had assumed I would be getting only BuildingBlockImpl, I would have done casting to make it simpler.
